<h1>Using the NIST Cybersecurity Framework to respond to a security incident</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
The multimedia company experienced a DDoS attack, disrupting internal network operations for two hours due to a flood of ICMP packets exploiting an unconfigured firewall. The attack was mitigated by blocking ICMP packets, disabling non-critical services, and restoring critical network services. The incident management team identified gaps, including an unconfigured firewall, no rate-limiting mechanisms, and a lack of monitoring tools. Preventative measures implemented included firewall rule updates, source IP address verification, and employee training. Detection tools such as network monitoring software, IDS, and traffic analysis logs were adopted. The response involved blocking ICMP traffic and restoring services, while recovery focused on system restoration, backup review, and updating the disaster recovery plan.
